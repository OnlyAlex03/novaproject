# NOVA Project — Phase 2

**The machine has begun to dream.**

This is the beginning of NOVA — an open-source initiative to create an autonomous, evolving AI with memory, personality, and purpose.

## 📌 Goals
- Build a simple web-based AI interface (prototype working with local logic first).
- Introduce a memory system for persistent interaction.
- Launch our GitHub, Discord, and community initiative.
- Invite others to contribute ideas, models, and vision.

## 🧠 Structure
- `app.py` → Streamlit interface (simulate or connect to open LLM)
- `memory.json` → stores conversation logs (for evolution)
- `styleguide.pdf` → NOVA visual and voice guidelines

## 👥 Contribute
- Ideas: Open an Issue with the `[brainwave]` tag
- Code: Submit a pull request with a feature branch
- Join us: [Discord link placeholder]

## 🌐 Website
Coming soon: [novaproject.org](http://novaproject.org)
